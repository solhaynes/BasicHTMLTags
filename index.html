  <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
  <h2>My name is Solomon Haynes</h2>

  <p>
    I ended up at ElevenFifty Academy because the traditional bachelor's
    degree path didn't feel like it was preparing me for the career I'm
    truly interested in.
  </p>

  <br>
  <br>

  <p>
    You may be thinking, "Which career is that?"  I'm interested in becoming
    a web developer (preferably front end).  I know it'll be a long road, but
    I'm willing to do what it takes to make it happen.
  </p>

  <h2>Why do I want to change careers?</h2>
  <p>Here's a few reasons:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I feel stuck in my current job (massage therapy).</li>
    <li>I'm hoping a web developer job will give me the freedom to work from home or potentially travel</li>
    <li>I'm ready for a career that challenges me enough mentally that I feel like I'm not wasting my potential</li>
    <li>
      Massage therapy forces me to work evenings.  I want a more consistent schedule so I can be present 
      in relationships/friendships.</li>
  </ul>
